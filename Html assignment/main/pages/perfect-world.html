        <p>
            Born into a unique world where villages fight to gain power and control, the main character, Shi Hao, is a
            genius blessed by the heavens born under the poorest of conditions. His clan, however, has a mysterious
            past.
            To rise up and become the genius he is meant to be, the clan goes through every effort to aid his
            cultivation
            as they battle through fanatical monsters and engage in power struggles with other clans. His journey will
            bring
            him through unknown lands until he is able to become a person that can truly shake the world.
