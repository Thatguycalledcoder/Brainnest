        Tang San spent his life in the Tang Outer Sect, dedicated to the creation and mastery 
        of hidden weapons. Once he stole the secret lore of the Inner Sect to reach the pinnacle 
        of his art, his only way out was death. But after throwing himself off the deadly Hell's Peak 
        he was reborn in a different world, the world of Douluo Dalu, a world where every person has a 
        spirit of their own, and those with powerful spirits can practice their spirit power to rise and 
        become Spirit Masters.The spirit that awakens within Tang San is Blue Silver Grass, a useless spirit. 
        Can he overcome the difficulties to reach the high ranks of Spirit Masters and bring the glory of the 
        Tang Sect into this new world?
